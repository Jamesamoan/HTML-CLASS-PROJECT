                <h3>Plants</h3>
                <p>Plants are the eukaryotic organisms that constitute the kingdom Plantae. They are predominantly photosynthetic, meaning
                that they obtain their energy from sunlight. They do that using the green pigment chlorophyll in their chloroplasts to
                produce sugars from carbon dioxide and water. Exceptions are parasitic plants that have lost the genes for chlorophyll
                and photosynthesis, and obtain their energy from other plants or fungi. Most plants are multicellular, except for some
                green algae.</p><p>
                
                Historically, as in Aristotle's biology, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and
                included algae and fungi. Definitions have narrowed since then; current definitions exclude fungi and some of the algae.
                By the definition used in this article, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (green plants), which consists of the green
                algae and the embryophytes or land plants (hornworts, liverworts, mosses, lycophytes, ferns, conifers and other
                gymnosperms, and flowering plants). A definition based on genomes includes the Viridiplantae, along with the red algae
                and the glaucophytes, in the clade Archaeplastida.</p>
